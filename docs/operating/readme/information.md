## Introduction

Welcome to the Eventiva repository. Eventiva is an open-source platform for Event Planning and Production logistics. We have created a custom-built directory focused on indexing, marketing and connecting event specialist Vendors, Venues and professionals. We then connected this to our innovative tools for event production planning which include scheduling, itinerary, task management, contact management, warehousing ticket sales, interactive site maps, online and in-person sales solutions, accounting, payroll and human resources.

## Why do we exist?

When surveyed, the industry revealed that over fifty-five percent of events did not have a management tool of any form. The remaining forty percent are split across solutions designed and implemented for office environments. Software like Flock and Excel barely cover the toolset which managers require to be effective in the preproduction sections of their work. While fifty-five percent of events did not have management tools, a full eighty percent of individuals surveyed believed that schedulers, task lists and other management tools would be helpful to their ongoing operations.

## Why open-source?

We believe in the power of community development, while our tools are designed and marketted for event planning, they can be utilised by organisations planning all variations of projects, we believe that through keeping our tools open-source we can connect with amazing developers who can contribute in ways we simply cannot fathom.
