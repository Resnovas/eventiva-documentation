Thank you for taking an interst in contributing. We have created development containers (`.devcontainer`) to allow you to jump straight in with coding. We even went through the hassle of setting up step by step guides using [CodeTour](https://github.com/vsls-contrib/codetour). Everything is configured and ready to go, all you need to do is use one of the supported platforms: [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) | [Github Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces)

This project uses the [Universal GitActions Workflows](https://github.com/Videndum/workflow-mastermind) to automate our workflow, alongside provide templates for issues and pull requests. If you want to learn more about precisely what this workflow accomplishes, please check out the documentation [here](https://github.com/Videndum/workflow-mastermind).

For more information on contributing, please read the [contributing guidelines](docs/contributing/README.md).
